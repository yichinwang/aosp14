    * Using ANDROID_BUILD_TOP might find the wrong tree (if external_updater is used to
      manage a project that is not in AOSP, as it does for CMake, rr, and a few others),
      since ANDROID_BUILD_TOP will be the one that built external_updater rather than
      the given project.
    * Paths relative to __file__ are no good because we'll run from a "built" PAR
      somewhere in the soong out directory, or possibly somewhere more arbitrary when
      run from CI.
    * Paths relative to the CWD require external_updater to be run from a predictable
      location. Doing so prevents the user from using relative paths (and tab complete)
      from directories other than the expected location.

    The result for one project should not be reused for other projects, as it's possible
    that the user has provided project paths from multiple trees.

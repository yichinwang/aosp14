/**
 * This abstract data class is intended to mirror {@link android.ondevicepersonalization.UserData},
 * which represents the policy-cleared user data instance.
 *
 * Chronicle requires a Kotlin data class to represent the data entity, but
 * Kotlin code is not allowed in public APIs, so this mirror class is created
 * as a workaround. See b/268739079 to track future solutions.
 *
 * If one class is updated, the other one should also be updated to match.
